# Html-Hyperlink-Narrative-Assignment-

I struggled a lot with finding a narrative to explore. I eventually landed on depression, although It's something I don't personally struggle with at this extreme. I'm aware of how it makes someone feel about themselves and others. I wanted to convey how depression limits someone by making the story feel multiple choice, but the other options are unassessable.
